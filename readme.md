# there's an unravelling... a coming together even...
# it'd be interesting to have this as an aspect of the architectural work...

# it could be a way to have things go though and carve out a space like a worm...
# other things that it could be...

# in terms of a bridge... maybe a box like or rectangular shape that comes together to be this thing...
# the inner structure is this... it's a massive sculpture rather than a piece of architecture. 


# how can we turn this out onto a 3d model...
